# Udemyclone-emc
This is my first web development project created during my training at EMC Academy. I built a responsive clone of the Udemy homepage using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on layout design, clean structure, and visual styling. It was a great hands-on experience to apply foundational front-end skills and bring a real-world interface to life.
