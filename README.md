# 🎓 Udemy Homepage Clone – HTML & CSS

This is my **first web development project** built during my training at **EMC Academy**. I recreated the **Udemy homepage** using only **HTML and CSS**, focusing on layout design, responsive structure, and visual styling. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of front-end development and how to bring real-world interfaces to life.
